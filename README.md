# Laughter Classification with Convolutional Neural Network

This project explores the classification of different types of human laughter using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our goal is to detect and classify four categories of laughter ‚Äî **chuckle**, **belly laugh**, **baby laughter**, and **evil laugh** ‚Äî using audio clips and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

## üìù Self-Evaluation

We completed all the goals outlined in our original project proposal. We successfully collected and labeled a dataset of laughter clips, performed MFCC feature extraction using librosa, and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify different types of laughter.

One additional improvement we made beyond the proposal was the inclusion of a fourth laughter category: evil laugh. This class added complexity and variety to the dataset and allowed us to test the model‚Äôs ability to generalize across more theatrical and unpredictable vocal patterns.

We are satisfied with the final outcome and believe the project meets all the criteria we initially set, along with offering an extra challenge we tackled successfully.
